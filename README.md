## About Me  
I build open-source tools focused on **outdoor analytics**, **AI-assisted navigation**, **GPS data tools**, and **IoT telemetry**.  
I like turning real-world motion and environment data into actionable insights.

- 🔭 Current projects:
  - **trail-pathfinder-ai** — AI system predicting optimal biking/hiking routes  
  - **gpstrack-cleaner-cli** — GPS/GPX optimization + anonymization tool  
  - **bikemate-iot-monitor** — IoT telemetrics module for real-time bike data  
- 🌱 Learning: geospatial AI, elevation modeling, BLE sensor integration  
- 📫 Email: ngunyijchege@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I measure bike rides in data points, not kilometers
